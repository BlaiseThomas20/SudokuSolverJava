# Sudoku Solver

This is a Java program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It takes a partially filled Sudoku board as input and attempts to fill in the remaining cells with valid numbers.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. The program will solve the Sudoku puzzle and display the solved board on the console.

## How It Works
The program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
It recursively fills in each empty cell with a valid number and backtracks whenever it encounters an invalid configuration. 
The algorithm continues this process until the entire board is filled.

## Example

Here's an example of a Sudoku puzzle represented as a 2D array in Java:

```java
int[][] board = {
 {7, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0},
 {6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9},
 {0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 7, 8},
 {0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 6, 0},
 {0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 9, 3, 0},
 {9, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5},
 {0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2},
 {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 0},
 {0, 4, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7}
};
